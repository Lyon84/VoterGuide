			Our Goal
		</br>
			</div>

			The Voter Guide will be an easily accessible app that allows users to access information about their entire ballot in one place.
			An un-biased source for information on all candidates.  In small and local elections citizens often have a difficult time
			finding information on the candidates and issues that will be on their ballot.  Voter Guide looks to change that and provide a
			necessary service that makes elections just a little bit less stressful.

		</br>
	</br>
			Some of the features available in the app include candidate profiles that contain not only important
					 background information such as background, where they live, job experience, education, etc.,
					 but also curated question that the candidate themselves will be invited to answer,
					 that will cover key issues for the principality and position for which they are running.
		</br>
	</br>
					 Other features will be a candidate comparison option that allows a yes/no comparison chart on
					 candidates running for the same office's positions on different key issues,
					  an incumbent chronology feature that allows users to view incumbent candidateâ€™s
						 history in office on the way the supported or were against different policy issues.
